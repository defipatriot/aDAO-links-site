                    <p>Eons ago, on a world now forgotten, humanity faced its end. Earth was dying, choked by war and depleted of life. In a final, desperate act of unity, the ten remaining nations forged the Alliance Coalition. Their greatest minds achieved the impossible: they discovered The Lattice.</p>
                    <p>The Lattice is a fundamental network woven into the fabric of reality, capable of bridging billions of light-years instantaneously. They constructed ten colossal 'Alliance Devices'-nodes designed to access this network. Fueled by a synthesized energy source that cost the planet its last resources, the Devices were activated.</p>
                    <p>This was the Last Journey, a one-way exodus that scattered the ten tribes of humanity across the distant Terra Galaxy, seeding life on ten barren worlds. The mission carried a singular hope: that humanity, in whatever form it took, would survive.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8 border-b border-gray-600 pb-2 mb-4">II. The Long Silence and the Divergence</h3>
                    <p>Seven million years passed. An epoch of silence stretched across the galaxy. The technology of Earth crumbled, the data archives failed, and the origins of the ten tribes faded into myth. This was the Great Forgetting.</p>
                    <p>Isolation and extreme environments relentlessly sculpted the descendants of Earth. On the high-gravity mountains of Crutha, they became dense and powerful. In the oceans of Lusa, they adapted to the pressures of the deep. In the toxic fields of Gredica, they retreated into technology to survive the very air. Humanity diverged into ten distinct post-human species.</p>
                    <p>The Terra Galaxy developed unevenly. In the Inner Ring, the worlds of Cristall, Minas, and Gredica clawed their way back to technological supremacy, forming the Triad Alliance and rediscovering localized space travel. Yet, even they remained unaware of their seven sister worlds lost in the vastness of the Mid-Ring and Outer Rim.</p>

                    <p>The ancient Alliance Devices were never meant to remain dormant. Embedded within them was the Protocol of Reunion-a directive to reconnect humanity once the colonies reached technological maturity.</p>
                    <p>The advanced energy experiments of the Triad Alliance inadvertently triggered the ancient, degraded network. The Protocol activated, but the network was broken, and the inhabitants' biology no longer matched the original human parameters. The Lattice spasmed.</p>
                    <p>In an instant, 10,000 individuals vanished from their homes and reappeared randomly across the ten worlds. This was The Warp-not a calculated reunion, but a catastrophic system failure. These Travelers arrived confused, terrified, and often in immediate danger. The seven million years of isolation ended in chaos.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-8 border-b border-gray-600 pb-2 mb-4">IV. The Living Keys</h3>
                    <p>The Travelers did not arrive empty-handed. They carried objects from their home worlds, ranging from primitive tools to advanced technology. But the most significant artifacts are the rarest, intrinsically linked to the Warp itself.</p>

These magnificent creatures are not mere birds; they are bio-engineered marvels created by the original Earth Alliance, designed to be the living navigation system for the Lattice. The Warp bonded 25 Phoenixes to specific Travelers. These individuals are the Navigators, the only ones capable of sensing and stabilizing the chaotic Warp energy.</p>

                    <p>The Warp has destabilized the entire Terra Galaxy. The Lattice is active but uncontrolled, causing random "Warp Echoes" that threaten all ten worlds. The sudden forced interaction between vastly different civilizations has ignited conflict and desperate alliances.</p>
                    <p>A race against time has begun. The Seekers-a coalition of Travelers and locals-strive to locate the Navigators and Catalysts to stabilize the network and bring everyone home. Meanwhile, The Ascendants-powerful factions within the Triad Alliance-seek to seize control of the Lattice to launch an era of interstellar conquest. The Purists reject their shared origin and and seek to eliminate the Travelers.</p>
                    <p>The fate of the ten worlds rests on the shoulders of the 10,000 Travelers. They must survive, unite, and unlock the secrets of their ancient past before the Echoes of the Alliance tear their galaxy apart.</p>
