            <h2>About AllianceDAO & ALLY Rewards</h2>
            
            <p>The AllianceDAO NFT is an NFT project launched to reward participants of the Game of Alliance (GOA). The GoA was an incentivized testnet designed to battle-test Terra’s Alliance module before its mainnet launch, and it ran from February 9th to March 2nd, 2023. During the game, users could stake on different Alliance chains and move their tokens around to optimize rewards as the parameters of each chain changed. Player’s final scores were calculated based on the total staking rewards they earned plus the points they earned from completing different missions. For more information on the Alliance module and how it works, visit the <a href="https://alliance.money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alliance website</a>.</p>

            <h3>How Rewards Work</h3>
            <p>The same smart contract that minted the AllianceDAO NFTs also minted an asset called “Ally.” This asset is solely owned by the NFT contract, and will never be transferred to anyone outside of the contract. On February 23, 2024, the Terra commuity passed a <a href="https://chainsco.pe/terra2/governance/proposal/4801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">governance proposal #4801</a> to add “Ally" as an Alliance asset, enabling the token to earn a portion of LUNA staking rewards. The current Reward Weight for “Ally” is .008 — or around .72% of total LUNA staking rewards. "Ally" currently has no Take Rate. Upon the proposal’s passing, the AllianceDAO voted to stake the Ally token to start earning LUNA rewards. The delegation of the asset is controlled by AllianceDAO governance and can be changed at any time, see Alliance ALLY validator delegations <a href="https://chainsco.pe/terra2/address/terra1phr9fngjv7a8an4dhmhd0u0f98wazxfnzccqtyheq4zqrrp4fpuqw3apw9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a>. Staking rewards will be collected periodically using Warp Protocol and stored in the AllianceDAO contract.</p>

            <h3>Eris Upgrade: LUNA to ampLUNA</h3>
            <p>In March 2024, AllianceDAO voted to build an alliance with Eris Protocol to convert the LUNA stored as rewards into ampLUNA, which passed and went live on June 15, 2024, increasing rewards by 40% over four years. In addition, the DAO will receive 5 Million Eris tokens, vested over four years. This upgrade also introduces a treasury share feature, which will divert 10% of rewards to grow the DAO treasury, enabling the DAO to expand and develop its initiatives.

            <p>After the contract collects the staking rewards, each NFT will accrue rewards at an equal rate. At any point, NFT holders can connect their wallet and use BoostDAO.io Ignite to “break” their NFT to claim their ampLUNA rewards. Importantly, NFT rewards can only be claimed once per NFT. Once an NFT has been broken, no more Alliance staking rewards will accrue to it. Although broken NFTs no longer accrue Alliance staking rewards, they can still be staked to the DAO on <a href="https://daodao.zone/dao/terra1sffd4efk2jpdt894r04qwmtjqrrjfc52tmj6vkzjxqhd8qqu2drs3m5vzm/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DAODAO.zone</a> to participate in governance.</p>

            <p>Each “unbroken” NFT will receive an equal proportion of the ever-growing Alliance reward pool. As users break their NFTs to claim rewards, the amount of outstanding, unbroken NFTs gets smaller, and their share of the reward pool gets larger.</p>

            <p>For example, if you own one of 10,000 “unbroken” NFTs, your NFT represents 1/10,000 of the pool. If 6,000 people break their NFTs, the number of unbroken NFTs will shrink, and your claim on the pool becomes 1/4,000 of the pool. The longer you hold your NFT without breaking it, the greater your reward will be.</p>

            <p>AllianceDAO NFTs are transferable, which means that if you send an unbroken NFT to someone, the wallet in possession of the NFT will be the only user that can claim the LUNA rewards.</p>
